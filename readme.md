This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Haas Python Workshop. No prior experience with Python is required to attend this workshop.

## Workshop Goals

This workshop provides a gentle introduction to data analysis in Python for learners with basic proficiency in Excel. We will compare common data analysis tasks in Excel with their equivalent operations in Python, examine the pros and cons of shifting from Excel to a scripting language environment, and complete a guided, end-to-end data analysis using Python.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can click the following link to open this repository in Google Colab, a cloud based python environment:

If you would prefer to download python onto your computer and work locally, you can follow the instructions below.

## Local Installation Instructions (OPTIONAL)

Anaconda is a useful package management software that allows you to run Python
and Jupyter notebooks easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make
sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop.
If you would like to run Python on your own computer, complete the following
steps prior to the workshop:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.9
   distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click the
   "Download" button.

2. Download the [workshop
   materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/HAAS-Python-Workshop):

   -   Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository
        information.
   -   Click "Download Zip".
   -   Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily
        access it (we recommend Desktop).

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:
1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time.

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Lab" and navigate through your file system to the HAAS-Python-Workshop folder you downloaded above.
