This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Haas Python Workshop. No prior experience with Python is required to attend this workshop.

## Workshop Goals

This workshop provides a gentle introduction to data analysis in Python for learners with basic proficiency in Excel. We will compare common data analysis tasks in Excel with their equivalent operations in Python, examine the pros and cons of shifting from Excel to a scripting language environment, and complete a guided, end-to-end data analysis project using Python

## Getting Started
